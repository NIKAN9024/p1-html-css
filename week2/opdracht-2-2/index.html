    <h1>HTML Fundementals</h1>
    <p><h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page.
        It acts as a 'blueprint' to display display on a user's screen. Th is is the basic 
        building block of the web. Every page on the internet is just HTML at its core.</p>
    <p><h2>What are HTML elements?</h2>
        Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be displayed.</p>
    <p><h2>What is a tag?</h2>
        An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between 
        the tags will be displayed per the instructions of the element.</p>
    <p><h2>Does the browser use HTML to create what i see?</h2>
        The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the 
        developer intended the data to appear on the screen.</p>
    <p><h2>What are the basic HTML-Elements?</h2>
        The elements we were learned about were html, head, body, 'p', span, div and h1-h6.</p>
    <p><h2>More Elements A-tag</h2>
        The 'a'("anchor")element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even within 
        our own web page) you will always see the 'a' element used with the href attribute 
        to tell the browser what adress you want to link the point to.</p>

    <p><h2>Img-tag</h2>
    This image will dislpay an image on the screen. It will always have an 'src' attribute 
    which points the address of the image to be displayed. NOTE: img tags 
    can be self-closing, as in they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before 
    the closing bracket in the first tag</p>
